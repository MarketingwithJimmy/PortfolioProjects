# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my skills and expertise in data analysis. Feel free to explore each project and its associated code files.

## About Me

I am a passionate data analyst with a strong background in extracting insights from complex datasets. My experience spans various domains, and I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable insights. My skills include data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization, as well as proficiency in Excel and Microsoft SQL.

## Projects

### 1. Google Capstone Project - Bike Sharing Marketing Analysis
Description: This project demonstrates my skills in wrangling data, cleaning it up, delving deep into analysis, and bringing it to life visually using both SQL and Tableau. In my role as a Marketing Analyst, I was on a mission to uncover strategies that would turbocharge Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company, in boosting their annual membership numbers. This entailed dissecting the behaviors of casual riders versus annual members, with the end goal of recommending marketing strategies that would increase annual membership sign-ups.
